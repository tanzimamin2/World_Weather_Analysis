# World_Weather_Analysis
This project aims to help tourists find and plan their trips. Users can provide input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the users will be able to choose four cities to create a travel itinerary.


### How might we provide real-time suggestions for our client's ideal hotels?

* Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.
* Our dataset consists of the following:-
 
    * City and country
    * Latitude and longitude
    * Maximum temperature
    * Humidity
    * Cloudiness
    * Wind speed
    
* We will use the weather dataset to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
* This will recommend potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.
* From the suggestions, the user will choose four cities.
* This will create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
* As well as Travel Itinerary Map
