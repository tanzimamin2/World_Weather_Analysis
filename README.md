# World_Weather_Analysis
This project aims to help tourists find and plan their trips. We aim to use the Google Maps Directions API, as a result users will be able to create routes between their destinations as well as a marker layer map.


### How might we provide real-time suggestions for our client's ideal hotels?

* Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.
* Our dataset consists of the following:-
 
    * City and country
    * Latitude and longitude
    * Maximum temperature
    * Humidity
    * Cloudiness
    * Wind speed
    
* We will use the weather dataset to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
* This will recommend potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.
* From the suggestions, the user will choose four cities.
* This will create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
* As well as Travel Itinerary Map
